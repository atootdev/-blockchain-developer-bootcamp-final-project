# Design Patterns

## Access Control
Have restricted access control to certain variables and functions by defining those variables as private, using the modifier onlyOwner(), and using the require statement.

## Inheritance and Interfaces
Have used inheritance to derive contract state and functions from a verified and audited source (OpenZeppelin). Inherited contracts include required arguments in header. Interface contracts ISneaker and ISneakerMetadata were created for extensibility.
