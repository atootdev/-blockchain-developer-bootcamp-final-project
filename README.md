# NFT Sneaker Drops

## Description:

An app that allows sneaker designers like Nike, Yeezy, Off-White, etc to create NFT tokens of their release drops. This will give buyers a sense of ownership of the sneaker and will also help authenticate sneakers in the after market.

## Workflow:

Shoe brands will set a time/date to open up sales for a new shoe drop on their website.

Users will buy the shoes and receive an authentication code via email.

Users will then visit the app website, connect via MetaMask and then copy/paste the authentication code into the search bar.

Users will then be able to mint their sneaker NFT.
