# The Credit Card Points Token

## Description:

A system that allows for exchanging credit card points with a new ERC20 token called Rewards Coin (RWD). The Rewards token, or coin, can be used like points to purchase flights, hotels, car rentals, etc. This will allow users to consolidate points into one central account (wallet) and use them interchangeably with all rewards partners.

## Workflow:

This app is a demo of the concept and will feature a dummy bank/credit card and travel providers.

User will earn points on credit card transactions.

User will access his points portal, exchange points for RWD, and then transfer them to their MetaMask address.

User will access the Rewards portal and connect with MetaMask.

The Rewards portal will allow the user to search for flights and hotels from a list of travel providers.

User will also have option to transfer coins to another address without paying a fee.
